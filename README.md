## Description

The mastermind website is about an engaging comprehensive online coaching program that is design to help individuals achieve their goals and dreams. The site offers individuals the chance to sign up for a membership to access different online resources and avail of the online coaching and group classes.

### Hosting and Technology:

-   Frontend: The project is built using a React application structure powered by Vite, a modern build tool for web development. This ensures a fast and efficient user experience on the website.
-   Backend: For handling data and requests, the project relies on an ExpressJS server, a popular Node.js framework known for its speed and flexibility. The backend server is responsible for managing various aspects of the online coaching and classes, such as product subscription, user accounts, and payment processing.
-   Database: To securely store and manage data, the project connects to a Firebase Cloud database. Firebase is a robust, scalable, and flexible platform, making it a suitable choice for this online store's data needs.
-   The website's frontend is hosted on Vercel, a cloud platform for front-end projects, known for its ease of deployment and scalability.
-   The backend server is hosted on Render, a platform that simplifies server deployment and management, ensuring reliable and efficient backend operations.
